"""Every routed page of the SPA, named once.

Shared by the route smoke test and the UI sweep so the two can never cover
different pages. Mirrors ``app/src/main.tsx`` plus the sub-tabs of Settings,
Access Control and Network; add a route here when you add one there.

Dynamic routes (``/apps/:appId``, ``/app-catalog/:appId``) need an installed
app and are left to the app tests.
