"""Every page renders for an admin without crashing.

The safety net for UI refactors: one parametrised test per route in
``app/src/main.tsx`` (plus the settings, access-control and network sub-tabs),
each asserting the four failures a restyle most often introduces and that no
API test can see:

* **an uncaught exception** -- a component that throws during render;
* **the error boundary** -- the route crashed and the shell caught it (it
  logs ``ErrorBoundary caught`` and shows "Something went wrong");
* **a 5xx from the API** -- the page's own requests failing server-side;
* **horizontal overflow** -- the page is wider than the window, so the whole
  view scrolls sideways.

Deliberately NOT asserted: plain ``console.error`` output. Several pages log
expected 404s (optional adapters, an app that is not installed), and a test
that fails on those would be red from day one and ignored thereafter. Such
messages are attached to the failure text only, for context.

Known failures are listed in ``KNOWN_5XX`` / ``KNOWN_OVERFLOW`` with the reason,
so the test is green on today's ``main`` and turns red on anything *new*.
Remove an entry when its fix lands -- that is what keeps the list honest.
