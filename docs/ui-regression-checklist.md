# UI regression checklist

This is a manual pass for UI refactors. The automated net catches a lot:
- route smoke and popup smoke tests
- admin and settings flows
- the before/after sweep with its API contract

This list covers what the automated net can't reach: real video, hardware, printing, and judgement calls. Tick every item for each page a change touches, in both **dark and light** themes. Where a line says "(FR)", switch the language to French too.

Run it against a local stack with fake cameras and at least two cameras publishing.

Legend:
- `[auto]` means an automated test already covers it. Glance at it anyway.
- Everything else is manual.
