"""Live-eval harness for the camera-agent: does the model pick the right
tool, with the right arguments, and answer from what the tool returned?

The live tier of the eval strategy in AGENT_DESIGN.md (Discussion #607).
The deterministic tier is tests/test_agent_evals.py; this one needs a real
model, so like tools/latency_harness.py it runs against a LIVE agent and
not in CI. The pure parts (case loading, scoring, aggregation) are
unit-tested in tests/test_eval_harness.py.

    python tools/eval_harness.py --url http://localhost:9100 \\
        --camera front_door --repeat 5 --throwaway --out run.json

RUN IT ONLY AGAINST A THROWAWAY AGENT. Cases arm real alarms and monitors
(the harness deletes the ones it created, but a monitor or alarm can fire
a real notification while it exists), queue background tasks it cannot
delete, and every case clears the agent's shared chat history (/reset).
--throwaway is required to say you read this.

How a run works, per case and repeat, strictly one at a time (the agent
keeps one chat history, so cases cannot run in parallel):

1. POST /reset (chat history only), then snapshot the ids in /alarms,
   /monitors, /tasks and /reports.
2. Send each turn to POST /ask and keep the reply and the trace.
3. Snapshot again — even when /ask failed, since a turn can arm an alarm
   and then fail composing its reply — and diff: what is new is what the
   turn created. Score it.
4. Delete what the case created, then read the collections back: a delete
   route answers 200 even when it removed nothing (an item outside the
   token's camera scope), so only the read-back says what is left.

A snapshot that cannot be read ends the case. Reading a failed GET as an
empty collection would make every existing alarm look created by the
case — and cleanup would delete the operator's own.

A case whose expected state already exists is not run: the agent would
reuse the existing rule ("Alarm #3 already covers that") instead of
creating one, so there is nothing the case could be scored on.

Background tasks a case queues are waited for before the next case
starts, and so is any turn the agent was still running: either would
otherwise share the model with, and create state inside, the next case.
A request that times out, or a task that does not finish, stops the run.

Scoring is deterministic, no LLM judge. Each tool step in the trace says
who chose it (`by`: model / router / forced) and the arguments as asked;
a final `reply` step says where the answer came from. Arguments are
checked twice, as Varun asked in #607: in the trace (what the model
asked for) and in the state read back (what the agent made of it after
its own normalisation).

Two columns per case:
  pass   the agent as a whole did the right thing (any chooser)
  model  the MODEL chose the right tool itself; a forced grounding or a
         router (tier 0) call does not count. "-" for tier-0 turns,
         where the model never chose.

Results are grouped by the router tier of the scored turn (tier 0 =
router decided, tier 1 = model was hinted, tier 2 = model alone). To
measure the model on its own, run the agent with router_tier0: false
and router_hints: false; the report records which way it was run.

Cases are YAML (PyYAML is already an agent dependency) or JSON; see
tools/eval_cases.yml for the format.
