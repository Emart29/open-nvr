"""The image installs what the lock says — and the pipecat we build on.

`publish-images` went red on main the day pipecat 1.12 appeared: the
Dockerfile installed a RANGE, the lock (what the tests run against)
pinned 1.8.1, and the image's punkt download had no nltk to run in. And
even when it built, the hand-kept list shipped numpy 2 / opencv 5 /
fastapi 0.141 against a lock that said 1.26 / 4.11 / 0.115. The lock is
the one source; the Dockerfile exports it.
