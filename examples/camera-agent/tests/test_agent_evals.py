"""STARTER EVAL SET — a behavioral spec for the camera agent.

Unit tests check *plumbing*; this file checks *behavior* on representative user
phrasings, so a refactor that quietly breaks tool routing or grounding gets
caught. It's the deterministic layer (routing, grounding gate, noise, end-to-end
on synthetic frames) that runs in CI with no LLM. The LLM-dependent cases (does
the model actually pick create_alarm for "alarm me if…") live in the live-eval
harness — see AGENT_DESIGN.md.

Grow this matrix as you add capabilities — it's the agent's regression net.
