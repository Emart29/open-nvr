"""Admission control for the background enrichers (#583).

Never wait, always drop
-----------------------
Enrichment — a caption, two VQA questions, an embedding per finished
visit — is a luxury the recorder and the detector must never pay for.
The field report that made this module: a CPU-only box, Ollama's
moondream at 30 s+ a frame, core timing out at 15 s and *releasing its
semaphore on the timeout*, so a fresh request went out while the model
was still computing the last one. 478 timeouts an hour, two cores
burnt, zero captions saved. The semaphore was the right idea with the
wrong release condition: it bounded how many requests core was
*waiting on*, not how many the adapter was *working on*.

So every adapter gets one :class:`AdapterGate` with three rules:

1. **Slots come from the adapter's own declaration.** ``scheduling.
   max_inflight`` in ``server/config/adapters_index.yml`` is what the
   adapter says it can take; a gate never opens more than that. A slot
   is held until the adapter *answers* — or until core gives up on it,
   at which point rule 3 applies.
2. **The wait line is short, and a full line drops.** Visits arriving
   while every slot is busy wait — this is background work — but only
   ``EVENTS_ENRICHMENT_QUEUE_DEPTH`` of them. The next one is dropped on
   the spot with a counter, not queued: a queue that grows is a box that
   is losing, and the visit is not lost — it has no ``event_text`` row,
   which is exactly what ``enrichment_backfill`` looks for.
3. **Timeouts trip a breaker.** ``EVENTS_ENRICHMENT_BREAKER_TIMEOUTS``
   in a row and the gate opens: nothing is sent for a cooldown (60 s,
   doubling to 10 min), one probe goes through when it expires, and the
   first success closes it again. Each trip records a system event
   (``enrichment_adapter_too_slow``) so the UI says *why* captions
   stopped, instead of the store silently staying empty.

Caption and VQA resolve to the same adapter on most boxes (moondream
answers both), so they share a gate: one slow model gets one budget,
not two. Plate OCR is deliberately NOT behind this — it is fast, once
per track, and losing a plate read is a worse outcome than losing a
sentence.

What the bound covers, honestly: what the ENRICHERS send. The agent's
scene descriptions, the plate sweep and the KAI-C service post to the
same adapters outside this module, so an operator asking "what do you
see?" while a caption is in flight puts two requests on a one-slot
model. The gate keeps enrichment from being the thing that piles on;
it does not make the adapter's total load observable from here.

The backfill asks the governor (``enrichment_governor.
wait_for_backfill_slot``) before every item; that wait includes
:func:`all_idle` here, so the back catalogue is only swept when nothing
live is in hand and no breaker is cooling. Live always wins; history
has waited this long.

    Only ReadTimeout/WriteTimeout count as "timed out": the connection
    was made and the adapter went quiet computing — the #583 shape. A
    ConnectTimeout is a host that never answered the SYN, a PoolTimeout
    is our own client; both are "unreachable" and count as an error,
    not a timeout, for the breaker.

    The slot is held until the adapter ANSWERED or core gave up — never
