"""Describe what a question needs, now — the requested lane (#583).

A search for "blue car on the gate camera between two and four" can be
answered only from visits somebody has already described. On a box
where enrichment is off (a CPU install — the installer's default), or
throttled, or simply behind, most of those visits have no caption and
no colour claim yet. Search answers from what exists and says so; this
module is the "and I'm describing the rest now" that goes with it.

Three parts:

* :func:`missing_for` — of the visits the question's STRUCTURAL filters
  match (label, camera, window, plate, zone), which lack the parameter
  the question needs: a caption when there are words to match, a claim
  of the kind an attribute asks for. Newest first, capped.
* :func:`request` — queue those for enrichment, deduplicated against
  what is already queued or in flight, and return a ticket the caller
  can put in its answer: how many, and roughly how long.
* :func:`run_requests_worker` — one worker, started at boot, that hands
  each visit to the SAME enrichers the ingest path calls, with the
  ``requested`` priority: the governor lets it through in LIVE-ONLY
  with a full wait line (somebody is waiting on this, unlike a live
  visit the catch-up will reach) and still refuses it PAUSED (the box
  is losing; a question does not change that). Each finished request
  is announced on the bus so the agent or the UI can ask again.

Bounded on purpose: ``EVENTS_ENRICHMENT_REQUEST_CAP`` visits per
question. "Last month" on a busy site is thousands; the answer to that
is a narrower window, not a queue that runs until tomorrow.
