"""Whether the box can afford enrichment right now (#583).

``enrichment_gate`` is the mechanism: per-adapter slots, a short wait
line, a breaker. This is the policy on top of it — a three-state answer
to "should any of that be sent at all", read from signals the box
already computes:

* the host monitor's last CPU sample and its ``cpu_high`` alert
  (``system_monitor_service``, sampled every 15 s for the UI anyway);
* each gate's smoothed latency, against ``EVENTS_ENRICHMENT_SLOW_CALL_S``
  — a model taking longer than that per call is behind the camera
  whatever the CPU figure says (a slow GPU model looks idle to psutil);
* any breaker open.

States, and what each one buys::

    NORMAL     live visits enriched through the gate; backfill allowed
               once things have been quiet for a while
    LIVE_ONLY  CPU above the soft threshold or an adapter running slow:
               captions and embeddings get NO wait line (a free slot or
               nothing), VQA keeps half of it — the colour and type the
               filters match on are worth more than a sentence when
               there is budget for one call, not three; backfill held
    PAUSED     the monitor's own cpu_high alert, or a breaker open:
               nothing is sent, nothing waits; backfill held

Steps UP are immediate — a box that is losing should stop losing now.
Steps DOWN wait ``STABLE_S`` of the calmer condition, so a CPU figure
bouncing around the threshold does not flap the state every 15 s.
Each change records one ``enrichment_throttled`` system event with the
reason, so the operator sees "captions paused: CPU 84%" rather than a
store that quietly stopped filling.

Busy is load, not clock. "Busy hours" happen on their own because the
CPU is busy then. ``EVENTS_ENRICHMENT_BACKFILL_WINDOW`` is the one
clock-shaped knob, for the back catalogue only: an operator who would
rather history were swept at 01:00–06:00 than whenever the box looks
idle at 14:00 can say so, and the governor honours both conditions.

Nothing here reads the DB or calls an adapter. It is evaluated lazily,
on each admission and each backfill step, from numbers already in
memory — cheap enough to ask every time and never worth a loop of its
own.
