"""The back catalogue: captions and claims for visits already recorded.

``caption_enrichment`` and ``descriptor_enrichment`` run off the INGEST
path. Everything that happened before they were deployed — every visit
on the box today — has a row in ``events`` and nothing in ``event_text``
or ``visit_descriptors``. So the first thing an operator does after
upgrading is search yesterday for "white van", get nothing, and conclude
the feature does not work. It works; it has simply never been pointed at
history.

This sweep walks that history and hands each qualifying visit to the
SAME enricher the ingest path calls.

It also repairs, for free, what the live path now does on every write:
projecting a visit's claims into ``event_text.attributes`` so they are
findable as words and not only filterable as rows, and turning a
``plate_text`` column into the ``plate`` claim the attr filter and
``journey.py``'s identity anchor both read. Neither needs an adapter, so
neither is gated by a skill assignment — the gate exists to stop
unasked-for inference, and there is none in a projection.

Not a fourth enricher
---------------------
There is no second copy of any rule here. The labels, the per-camera
assignment gate, the plan lookup, the vocabulary, the three-phase session
discipline, the "already done" short-circuit and the write itself all
stay where they are: this module decides only WHICH visits to offer and
HOW FAST. If the two ever disagreed about what a caption is worth, a
search would return different answers for last week and last hour, and
nothing in the UI would explain why.

Newest first, and it never comes back
-------------------------------------
The walk is by descending event id from a persisted cursor, so it starts
at the most recent history and works backwards. Two reasons, both
practical. An operator searching "last Tuesday" wants the last fortnight
long before they want last spring; and retention is deleting the oldest
rows anyway, so a forward walk would spend inference on visits that age
out before anyone searches them.

The cursor is why "looked and found nothing" costs nothing twice. The
enrichers record that they ran — ``EventText`` for a caption,
``ran_tasks`` in ``payload["enriched_by"]`` for claims — and skip a visit
they have already handled, but a visit that was looked at and yielded
nothing usable still matches the cheap SQL filter below. Without a cursor
the sweep would re-offer that visit on every pass and never reach the one
behind it. With one, every visit is considered exactly once, and the pass
that reaches the oldest row is the last pass.

Off by default, and deliberately slow
-------------------------------------
This is the one enrichment path that can spend a lot of inference without
anybody doing anything, so ``events_enrichment_backfill`` defaults to
False: upgrading a running site must never quietly start working through
its back catalogue on the GPU the live cameras are using. When it is
switched on, items are processed one at a time with a pause between them
— live ingest and this sweep share one adapter and one semaphore, and
live work must always win. History has waited this long; it can wait a
few more hours.
